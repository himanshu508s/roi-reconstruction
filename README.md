# roi-reconstruction
3D reconstruction for various shapes via their decomposition into baseic geometric shapes.

The decomposition of 3D shapes into basic geometric shapes is performed via Metric tensors and Christoffel symbols features. The corresponding code is found in Feature folder. Furthur preocessing is done in MATLAB , with results for synthethic dataset of Head demonstrated. For detailed datasets, contact host.
